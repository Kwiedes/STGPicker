# STGPicker
Simple game picker. 

STGPicker is designed to take in 5 items and stores them into a main list.
The user rolls through them to pick a random item from the list. 

This application was created by Nine Worlds / Kwiedes, to be used a randomized picker for video games. However, it can take in any input. 

**Creators remark**
I made this application because I find myself sitting in front of my computer attempting to pick a game
to play with my friends for a far greater time than I spend actually playing said game.
I created this to input games we have in common manually and roll through them to single out a selection.
This allows us to spend more time gaming and less time bickering about what to play. 


**Application Details**

STGPicker is a clean, simple picker. The user can input up to 5 items, and click the top button to pick through them randomly. 

Lists can be saved into a txt document and txt documents can be loading back into the main list.
This is to allow users to save their files remotely and load them up for what ever mood they are into. I.e This file contains RPGs, FPS etc.

If the user does not like their roll, they can go into the Edit menu and hit reset.
